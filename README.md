# Electro_new

Electo is an E-commerce front end project. Electo is a responsive and dynamic Single Page Application built using modern JavaScript syntax such as arrow function classes etc.
The main structure of the page is built with CSS grids and flex box.
Technologies used:
JavaScript, SCSS, CSS, html and webpack (node and express)
For the products data I built a simple node API using express, which can be found in the ElectroAPI repo.
The starting JavaScript file: App.js
