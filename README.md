# Electro_new

Electo is an E-commerce front end Single Page Application, and it uses the local storage to manage cart data.
In the application I make use of modern JavaScript syntax (such as classes, arrow functions etc.), and CSS’s grid and flex box. 

Technologies used:
JavaScript, SCSS, CSS, html, and  webpack.

The app’s starting JavaScript file: App.js.

For the products data I built a simple Node.js API using Express.js, which can be found in the ElectroAPI repo.
