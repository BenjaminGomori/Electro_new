# Electro_new

Electo is an E-commerce front end project. Electo is a Single Page Application built using modern JavaScript syntax such as arrow function classes etc.
The main structure of the page is built with CSS grid and flex box.
Technologies used:
JavaScript, SCSS, CSS, html and webpack. 
For the products data I built a simple node API using express, which can be found in the ElectroAPI repo.
The starting JavaScript file: App.js
